Rules

Component that tells the user which frame/ball they are on

Implement a 'daily' mode, with some sort of tracker recent dailies (line graph?)

Some sort of check 'Are you sure you want to pass, there are still pins you could knock down?'

Can we write a depth-first search for a best possible play? If so and if performant, can we make a perfect AI opponent (codename: Graeme) to compare against. Another idea - could we have a 'time travel' mode where you can go back to earlier plays in order to perfect them?
